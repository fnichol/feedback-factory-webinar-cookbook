# feedback-factory

The Chef cookbook used to setup the "Test Kitchen: Your Development Feedback Factory" [webinar](https://www.chef.io/webinars/), presented August 26, 2015.

Note that this cookbook is meant to be illustrative, not necessarily runnable (although you may find, it just might work for you). This is especially true for the `.kitchen.yml` file: there are some evil tricks at work but that's vicious pragmatism in action, folks.
